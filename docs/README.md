# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation! This README provides an overview of how OctoAcme runs projects and helps new contributors and team members quickly understand our approach.

> **Related Issue**: This documentation structure was created as part of [issue #2](https://github.com/harishThadka/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/2).

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our processes apply to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on five fundamental principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

## Project Lifecycle

Projects at OctoAcme follow a structured lifecycle with clear phases and decision gates:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and create high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, align on timelines
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate using agile practices
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production with proper verification and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

## Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates agile ceremonies, removes impediments, and coaches the team
- **Technical Writer**: Creates and maintains documentation, user guides, and knowledge bases
- **UX Designer**: Creates user-centered designs through research, prototyping, and testing
- **Release Manager**: Coordinates and oversees the release process and deployment
- **Support Lead**: Manages customer support operations and bridges gaps between customers and product teams
- **Security Champion**: Advocates for security best practices and coordinates security reviews
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and feedback

> For detailed role definitions, responsibilities, and interactions, see [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, teams maintain these essential artifacts:

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Communication Cadence

- **Weekly sync** between PM + PdM
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery team (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**
- **Ad-hoc escalations** as needed

## Best Practices

- Keep the Project Charter updated in your project repository
- Add process-specific documentation into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context
- Review and update the Risk Register weekly
- Hold retrospectives after each sprint, release, or important milestone
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
